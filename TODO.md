### TO-D0:
- understand beat_this
- fine-tune
- (do i need to 'crop' songs from the beginning for fine-tuning or?)

### Maybe later:
- 

### Decisions were taken:
- madmom is a bit outdated, the same lab has a new model called beat_this, i'll check it out
- another issue with madmom is the fact that the DBN was written using that archaic code - maybe the beat_this paper provides a modern torch implementation of DBN? alternatively, i could try implementing the dbn as a project during the bda course
